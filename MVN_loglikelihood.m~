function [ll] = ICA_loglikelihood(X, model)
% Calculate the log likelihood of X, given an ICA model.
% 
% The model assumes each column of x is independently generated by single 
%
% Arguments
%  X - A DxM matrix, whose every column corresponds to a patch in D
%      dimensions (typically D=64).
%  model - A struct with field:
%           cov - A DxD covariane matrix.
%  noise - the std of the noise in y.
